### **How do meal kits work, and what are the different types available?**

Meal kits are pre-portioned meal ingredients that are delivered to your doorstep, often with recipes and cooking instructions. These kits can contain all the ingredients needed to prepare a specific meal, or they can provide the ingredients for a number of meals that can be prepared throughout the week.

Meal kits are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer a convenient way to cook at home without the need to shop for ingredients. They can be a good option for people who are short on time or want to try new recipes without the hassle of grocery shopping. Additionally, meal kits can help reduce food waste, as they only provide the exact amounts of ingredients needed for a recipe, without any excess.

Meal kits can be a convenient and affordable way to cook at home, and can be a good option for people looking to save time, try new recipes, or improve their cooking skills.

There are several different types of meal kits available, each with their own unique characteristics:

### **1. Classic Meal Kits**

These meal kits typically come with pre-portioned ingredients for a complete meal, including a protein, vegetables, and a starch, along with a recipe and cooking instructions. In the context of the UK, the most popular meal kit providers are Hello Fresh, Gousto or Mindful Chef.

### **3. Snack Kits**

These kits come with a variety of snacks and treats, often with an emphasis on healthy or organic options.

### **4. Special Diet Kits**

These meal kits cater to specific dietary needs, such as vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or low-carb diets. Many meal kit companies also offer vegetarian or vegan meals, check out individual providers to find out more.

### **5. Global Cuisine Kits**

These meal kits offer ingredients and recipes from around the world, allowing you to explore new and exotic flavours in the comfort of your own home.

### **6. Condiment kits**

These offer a collection of sauces, spices or spreads to help you spice up your cooking. They can be a great way of exploring new flavours and cuisines.

Overall, meal kits offer a convenient and often affordable way to cook at home, and can be a good option for people looking to save time, try new recipes, or improve their cooking skills.
