### Are meal kits good for the environment?

Meal kits have become a popular way to cook at home, and many people,
including us, are wondering if they are good for the environment. Let\'s
take a closer look at the pros and cons of meal kits to see if they are
really as green as they seem.

## What are meal kits and what are their main benefits?

Meal kits come with pre-measured ingredients and a set of recipes which

you pick yourself ahead of the delivery. In the UK, there are a number

of companies that offer different types of meals and cuisines, such as

Hello Fresh, Gousto or Mindful Chef. They are great at reducing the time

you spend grocery shopping and meal planning. In addition, some meal kit

companies specialise in organic, sustainable or local ingredients, so

you can feel good about what you're eating and where it came from.
Meal

kits are also a great way to try out new recipes or explore cuisines

that you might not otherwise try. And finally, they're often more

affordable than eating out at a restaurant and can be cheaper than

buying groceries from your local

supermarket\](https://www.whichmealservice.com/blog/posts/are-meal-kits-worth-it),

especially if you get an introductory offer.

## What makes meal kits good for the environment?\*\*

# 1.Reduced food waste

By providing just the right amount of ingredients, meal kits are great

for ensuring that you do not buy more than what you need. This is

especially important when it comes to perishable items, such as

vegetables. The downside of this is that you cannot use the leftover

ingredients for another meal, such as lunch the next day.

### 2. Local or seasonal produce

Some meal kit providers, such as Mindful Chef in the UK, take

sustainability seriously. They work with local farmers to reduce the CO2

emissions stemming from transporting the ingredients from the other side

of the world.

### 3. Vegan or vegetarian menu

Most also offer vegan or vegetarian options and some providers focus

solely on vegetarian or vegan meals. Depending on the provider, you can

do your part for the planet by either opting for predominantly

vegetarian or vegan meals or simply choosing a brand that is purely

dedicated to the vegan or vegetarian cause.

### 4. B corp membership

Some meal kit companies go the extra mile when it comes to helping the

planet as well as having a positive social impact and show this through

the \[B Corp

Certification\](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification). B
Corp

Certification is a designation that a business is meeting high standards

of verified performance, accountability, and transparency on factors

from employee benefits and charitable giving to supply chain practices

and input materials. In the context of meal kits, this includes

achieving Net Zero by 2030, using recycled packaging and paying

attention to welfare and environmental considerations throughout their

supply chain. Our website accounts for the environmental and social

impact of UK meal kit provides by showing a Social and Environmental

score for each. You can find this score next to other information about

the meal kit provider on our \[home

page\](https://www.whichmealservice.com/). We are also planning on

exploring the topic of B corp certification in a future article so stay

tuned!

## What makes meal kits bad for the environment? \*\*

### 1. CO2 emitted during delivery \*\*

Meal kits are delivered straight to your door, which inevitably leads to

some CO2 emissions. However, these might be actually \_lower\_ than the

emissions from your local supermarket\\\'s supply chain, especially if
you

tend to buy ingredients sourced from far away. Some meal kit companies

disclose this information and B Corp certification is also a good place

to look at if you are after details statistics.

### 2. Packaging

Many of the ingredients that you order as part of your weekly meal kit,

such as meat or perishables, need to be chilled as they are transported

to you. This means that they come with additional packaging, such as

insulation or ice packets. Some of the packaging might not be recyclable

however we recommend you check with each individual provider as many

have recently improved the recyclability of packaging materials.

## So are meal kits good for the environment?\*\*

Well, that depends on your perspective. The truth is that there\\\'s no

easy answer when it comes to the environmental impact of meal kits and

the answer is usually relative. On the one hand, they can help reduce

food waste and save energy by not requiring you to prepare more food

than you need. But on the other hand, their packaging can be difficult

to recycle and they often require refrigeration.

At the end of the day, it\\\'s up to each individual to assess how the

meal kits\\\' environmental impact compares to the way they source their

food already. Still, if you\\\'re looking for an easy way to cook
healthy

home-made meals without spending too much time in the kitchen, meal kits

are a good solution.
